# About
This project is a multi-page website for a fictional band (which shares the name of the band I play in). The highlights are:
- Code written with React, React Router, and SASS
- Responsive web design with dynamic typography 
- Faux backend made with MirageJS
- A custom audio player
- Frontend storefront logic
- Protected routes for users and admin

# Media
The images used in the project are, except for the image from the Colosseum (I took that one), generated with Bing's image AI. The quality of the iterations varies quite a bit. I'm pleased with the product images, except for their spelling. The band photos are, at best, psychedelic. It is perfectly ok to laugh at the bendy guitar necks, the melted faces, and the hands with multiple fingers. 

The songs are demos made by Blåräv (I'm the guitarist and main songwriter) and home-recorded demos made by me. Those you cannot laugh at. I'm cereal. 

# Things I would have liked to add
I'm relatively perfectionistic, and this project has dragged on for long enough. So, the features I would have liked to add are:
- A MERN stack for password security and file management
- Login with JasonWebToken (JWT) and bcrypt
- A search bar
- Accessibility implementation, like ARIA labels

# Additional information
The website started as a handful of ideas and kept evolving throughout the project. How I wrote and organized the code reflects this. In other words, the code probably looks "off" here and there. The SCSS files need some refactoring to make them DRYer and more coherent. 

I tested the website's responsiveness on a 24-inch monitor (Firefox), a gen5 iPad from 2017 (Safari), and a Samsung Galaxy S9 (DuckDuckGo). 

# Known bugs
## Audio player
- The song title scrolls too far when the audio player initially loads
- The volume slider does not affect the volume output on iOS (at least not on my iPad)
